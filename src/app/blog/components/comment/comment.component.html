    <p class="comment__content">There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have
      suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly
      believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything
      embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat
      predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over
      200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks
      reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or
      non-characteristic words etc.</p>
